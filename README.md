# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To capture live network packets using Wireshark, identify basic protocols, and analyze their purpose in network communication.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**
- **Wireshark**

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Performed

1. **Launched Wireshark** in Kali Linux using:
   ```bash
   wireshark
## Steps Performed

- Selected the active network interface (`wlan0` for Wi-Fi in my case).
- Started packet capture and generated traffic by:
  - Visiting multiple websites.
  - Running ping commands:
    ```bash
    ping google.com
    ```
- Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
- Applied protocol filters in Wireshark:
  - `dns`
  - `arp`
  - `icmp`
- Noted down packet details for each protocol.
- Saved the capture as `task5.pcap`.
- Took screenshots of filtered packet views and details.

## ðŸ“Š Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Purpose | Example Packet Info |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **DNS**  | Resolves domain names to IP addresses | Query: `A google.com` |
| **ARP**  | Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses | Who has 192.168.0.1? Tell 192.168.0.10 |
| **ICMP** | Tests network connectivity | Echo request to 8.8.8.8 |
